1. Itâ€™s better to use bare fingers rather than finger cots.
2. To manually remove fingers from the scanned image:

   * Download **Photoscape**
   * Select the **Tools** tab
   * Use the **Spot restoring Brush** tool
3. To convert scanned images to EPUB format, use **Kindle Comic Converter**.
   EPUB manages images internally using HTML links, allowing for faster image rendering compared to PDF-converted images.
4. **Kindle Comic Converter** -> Please turn off cropping mode. If it is turned off, it may cause unintended behavior.
5. **CZUR** scanners use **ABBYY OCR** internally. However, enabling OCR may distort scanned images due to the inherent nature of OCR processing.
