# Memo & Tips for Czur Book Scanner

The Czur Book Scanner is not the perfect solution for scanning a book. However, it is a reasonable option if you want to scan a book by yourself without damaging it.

You may prefer to use it primarily for scanning books, despite the app supporting embedded OCR and image editing features, as these features can sometimes cause unexpected behavior, such as distorting the scanned image.

### Tips

1. Itâ€™s better to use bare fingers rather than finger cots.
2. To manually remove fingers from the scanned image:
   * Download **Photoscape**
   * Select the **Tools** tab
   * Use the **Spot Healing Brush** tool
3. To convert scanned images to EPUB format, use **Kindle Comic Converter**.
   EPUB manages images internally using HTML links, allowing for faster image rendering compared to PDF-converted images.
4. **Kindle Comic Converter** -> Please turn off cropping mode. If it is turned on, it may cause unintended behavior.
5. **CZUR** scanners use **ABBYY OCR** internally. However, enabling OCR may distort scanned images due to the inherent nature of OCR processing.
6. You can apply **OCR** at any time after scanning by using an **OCR** application directly.
